# Motivation

If a telematics system provider (TSP) suddenly goes out of business (have had two examples of this in 2018) any
commercial fleet relying on their service will need to find a new provider. Due to the lack of a standardized
data format and methods for retrieving telematics logs & data, a commercial fleet manager will have to reintegrate an alternate telematics provider's data format into
their existing system reporting.

The Open Telematics API (OTAPI) is intended to make the TSP-Carrier interface the same across multiple TSPs. It is not
intended to specify any aspects of the TSP's connections to their telematics devices. Neither does it imply any changes
to the location where data is stored or access controls on the data -- the data will still live at the Motor Freight
Carrier as-sourced from their accounts at the TSP.

![NMFTA Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api/master/media/overview.png)

This is a standardized API for retrieving telematics logs & data.
Each participating TSP would be individually responsible for the necessary
translations from their existing formats to this Open Telematics
API. Each TSP would continue to be responsible for managing their
own cloud infrastructure housing customer data. The Open Telematics API, as an additional interface,
will be made available by TSPs to allow their customers ready
access to pull data in the standardized format, especially in examples
of mixed TSP fleets.

# Contributors

This Open Telematics API was made possible through the generous contributions of thought leadership and technical expertise
of many collaborators across the heavy vehicle cyber security community, working to push the industry forward and make it
more resilient. Though some of our contributors wish to remain anonymous, we are deeply grateful to everyone who has given
their time and energy to make this a reality.

# Authentication
<a id="authentication"></a>

**All requests** to Open Telematics API endpoints **require authentication**.

For this version of the API, `v1`, all authentication must be performed using HTTP Basic. e.g.

```http
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```

This authentication method relies entirely on the security protections provided by the TLS layer; therefore HTTPS is
mandatory on all connections and implementors must follow adhere to the security requirements detailed in the [Security Requirements for Implementors](#security_requirements_for_implementors) section below.

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must provide a means to create username-password pair credentials and these
must be associated with roles (see section [Authorization](#authorization) below).

# Authorization
<a id="authorization"></a>

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must include access controls for requests against the following roles.

* *Vehicle Query*
* *Vehicle Follow*
* *Driver Query*
* *Driver Follow*
* *Driver Dispatch*
* *Driver Duty*
* *HR*
* *Admin*

It must be possible for clients to usernames for Authentication (see above) which are assigned to **one role and no more
than one role**.

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must restrict authorization of requests to only those roles that are assigned
in the **Access Controls** tables throughout this API specification. The tables will look like the following example:


|Role:  |Vehicle Query|Vehicle Follow|Driver Query|Driver Follow|Driver Dispatch|Driver Duty |HR          |S&C         |Admin       |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|Access:|`DENY/ALLOW` |`DENY/ALLOW`  |`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW` |`DENY/ALLOW`   |`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW`|

The intent of these access controls is so that carriers can limit which clients they deploy have access to:
* streaming *feeds* of objects as they are added to the TSP
* any Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

As can be seen in the **Access Controls** tables in the requests subsections of *References* that follow, the roles
are assigned `DENY/ALLOW` such that:

* the *X Query* roles have access only to collections queries
* the *X Follow* roles have access to streaming feeds and queries
* the *Vehicle X* roles cannot access any PII
* the *Driver X* roles can access both vehicle info and PII
* the *Driver Dispatch* role is allowed to update route info and send messages to drivers
* the *Driver Duty* role is allowed to externaly trigger driver duty status (e.g. *Send Duty Status Changes to the TSP*)
* the *HR* role is allowed to perform HR use cases and update Driver information
* the *S&C* roles is allowed to perform Safety and Compliance use cases and to update TSP portal user account username, password and enable/disable

# Security Manifest

The Open Telematics has been design with security up-front. Here we capture some NIST 800-53 controls which are satisfied
by the present design of OTAPI and how. The intent of this section is to give some assurance of security-by-design in the
OTAPI.

***NIST 800-53 SC-6: Resource Availability / URL size should not exceed 2000 characters***

None of the URLs in any of the endpoints of OTAPI will exceed a maximum of 220 characters. The longest resource path is
`/v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/availability_factors/` which would be 104 characters long if a 68 character `driverId` were
used. The endpoints have between 1 and 3 query string parameters, most are dates which are expressed in ISO 8601 format,
24 characters long the others are opaque IDs which could be up to 68 characters long. Worst case URL length is 104 + 24 + 24 + 68 (220) characters.

***NIST 800-53 SC-6: Resource Availability / HTTP request size should not exceed 1MB limit***

All `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` methods in the OTAPI are specific with JSON Schema blocks over-and-above API Blueprint specifications which include maximum field lengths. The maximum requests size for any of the endpoints in OTAPI is under
4K.

***NIST 800-53 SI-10: Information Input Validation / All file references should be indirect***

There are no direct file references in OTAPI; all objects are referred to by opaque identifiers and furthermore the data export API returns a URL for dereferencing and not a file.

***NIST 800-53 AC-3: Access Enforcement / Considerations: Grant privileges directly to users***

The OTAPI is designed for machine to machine communications; as such the privileges for access to OTAPI information is
granted to the motor freight carrier backend systems which integrate with OTAPI services. The privileges assigned
can be minimized, however -- see sections [Authentication](#authentication) and [Authorization](#authorization).

***NIST 800-53 AC-24: Access Control Decisions / Considerations: Security controls assigned to each request***

OTAPI requires valid authorization with each request; see section [Authentication](#authentication).

***NIST 800-53 AU-6: Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting / Considerations: Grant privileges to specific users***

OTAPI is designed with segmented privileges and separated user roles so that privileges are granted to specific roles
and no more privilege is used than is needed. See section [Authorization](#authorization).

# Security Requirements for Implementors
<a id="security_requirements_for_implementors"></a>

All TSPs that implement an Open Telematics API instance are expected to
provide a secure service by default. In what follows we outline some
security requirements that are expected in addition to the authentication
and access control that is detailed in the sections above.

## General Security Requirements

Vendors must maintain a vulnerability response and disclosure program in
accordance with established standards such as International Organization
of Standards (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
29147:2014 (Information technology \-- Security techniques \--
Vulnerability Disclosure) and ISO/IEC 30111:2013 (Information technology
\-- Security techniques \-- Vulnerability Handling Processes).

Vendors should ensure their vulnerability response and disclosure
program conforms with the ['Legal bug bounty' safe-harbor requirements](https://github.com/EdOverflow/legal-bug-bounty)
to protect researchers and encourage the highest-quality participation.

## Open Telematics API Server Security Requirements

**TLS Configuration**

The TLS security for Open Telematics API servers is of paramount importance. All of the confidentiality and integrity
protections are relying on this layer. For this reason, Open Telematics API servers must ensure that their HTTPS / TLS
configurations are of the highest quality. Following the [Qualys SSL Labs
Guide](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices) is reccomended.  The automated
tool, also by Qualys SSL Labs, at [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) will report a
'letter grade'; it is expected that TSPs will have letter grades of 'A' or higher according to that tool.

**Whitelist HTTP Methods**

This API specification (in *APIBlueprint*) has a complete list of all allowable *HTTP methods* for each resource/'end
point' of the Open Telematics API. Open Telematics server implementations should use the list of methods as a whitelist
to filter incoming requests before any additional processing.

**Rate-limit API Requests**

Since every request to the Open Telematics API must be authenticated it is possible to rate-limit Open Telematics API
requests per authenticated user. Vendors should implement rate limits on overall API requests per authenticated user,
e.g. to avoid one user exhausting server resources of others; however, vendor must not rate-limit any Open Telematics
API implementations to rates below what is offered through their other API services for telematics data. Rate-limiting
response must be implemented using response 429 and headers as detailed in this document.

**Prevent Brute-Forcing**

Authentication (for this version of the API) is tied exclusively to HTTP Basic in each request. This means that each and
every API endpoint is an opportunity to brute force any of the user credentials. Open Telematics server implementors
must enforce a global rate-limit on authentication attempts for each user. Implementors may also want to consider other
mitigations against brute-force attacks on credentials; c.f. [the OWA page on Blocking Brute Force
Attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks).

**Prevent Server-Error Stacktraces**

Open Telematics server implementors must ensure that their software is deployed such that it does not include stack
traces in any response; e.g. no stacktraces in a 500 server error response.

**Prevent Resource Exhaustion by Slow-posting**

Open Telematics server implementors must ensure that, when receiving data from clients, the server implements short-
enough timeouts such that exhaustion of the server resources through malicious client 'slow-posting' is not possible.
For more details, consult this [Qualys blog post](https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2011/11/02/how-to-protect-
against-slow-http-attacks).

**Input Sanitization**

Open Telematics server implementors must employ input sanitization when ingesting any data, i.e. for the `POST`, `PUT`,
`PATCH` methods. This API uses exclusively JSON for data serialization; therefore, at a minimum all input data should be
verified as valid JSON before being further processed. Furthermore, this specification includes generated JSON schema
for the expected inputs and so additional verification that the input JSON conforms to the expected schema can also be
performed before further processing is performed.

## Open Telematics API Client Security Requirements

**Certificate Pinning**

Because the confidentiality of credentials is only protected by TLS in this version, it is
very important that all Open Telematics API clients must be configured such that substitution of
any TLS certificates results in a failure to establish any connections
to the Open Telematics API server.

All clients must implement certificate pinning. i.e. All client implementations will pass the tests, 5.4-5.6, for
certificate pinning in the [OWASP MASVS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide).

# Working With Dates
<a id="working_with_dates"></a>

When exchanging dates as parameters to API methods or in responses from the API, you must ensure that
they are formatted properly as an ISO 8601 string (format
`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ`). In addition, all dates will have to first be
converted to UTC in order to ensure time zone information and daylight
savings times are accounted for correctly.

# Working with Time-Based Queries

There are many API endpoints which support searches of data based on a time range. In all cases, the time range specified
by a pair of `start` and `stop` parameters represents an inclusive-exclusive time range. i.e. a time period which
includes the moment in time given by `start` and all times up-to but not including the moment in time given by `stop.`

The matching performed in all of these searches will be a time-intersection. i.e. the objects will be returned in search
results if their associated time periods (however defined) have any intersection with the inclusive-exclusive time range
given by the pair of `start` and `stop` parameters.

Objects may have multiple time periods associated with them; e.g. events recorded and transmitted by TSPs may have the
times at which the event was created, when it was recorded and/or when it was made available by the TSP to the motor
freight carrier. Unless otherwise specified, the time period of objects against which matching is performed will be the
*creation times*. Furthermore, implementors are required to ensure that the creation times of any objects are preserved
through all data transfers, i.e. that the creation times are not modified after initial recording at the telematics
devices in the field.

In the special case of matching against an object with a single time field, *instantaneous events* the object will be
returned if its instantaneous time value is within the inclusive-exclusive time range given by the pair of `start` and
`stop` parameters.

# Working With Locations

When exchanging locations as parameters to API methods or in responses from the API, you must ensure that they are
formatted as a latitude+longitude pair (format `[-]aaa.aaaaaaa [-]ooo.ooooooo`). Positive in the first component,
Latitude, indicates North (N) and East (E) in the second component, Longitude.

Note that all locations assigned to objects by the TSP in the OTAPI are done so on a best-effort basis. Different TSPs
have different rates of location update, different accuracies and different means of mapping a previously known location
into events after the known location (e.g. prediction vs. interpolation). This Open Telematics API specification does not make
any specifications about how often, how accurate or any other statements about how geographic locations must be assigned
to objects by the TSP.

# Working with *Feed Follow* Queries

There are endpoints of the API which are intended to be polled by clients so that new data (data newer than the previous
query) is returned. Theses *Feed Follow* endpoints are intended to assist in real-time client applications.

In some cases, the clients require that no data is ever missed by following (polling the endpoint); however, due to the
nature of telematics systems there can be a high latency between time of creation and time of delivery to the TSP. Hence
there is a non-trivial cost associated with providing endpoints that can ensure that no data is missed in following.
e.g. the *Follow a Feed of Log Events* endpoint below.

Unless stated otherwise, all *Feed Follow* endpoints will be such that no data is missed by following; including cases
of very high latency between data creation and delivery. Special exceptions will be noted on the endpoints for the cases
where the clients require that they have the newest information and are not concerned with ensuring that no data is
missed.

# Error States

The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.

# Pagination

Where requests may return large collections and where the collections to be returned are presumed to be static the API
will include support for pagination of requests. The scheme for pagination closely follows [the pagination scheme of github](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).

Requests that are paginated will return 50 items by default. The `page` parameter can be used to access later pages;
it defaults to the first page, page *1*. A custom number of items can be requested with the `count` parameter.

The total number of elements available is returned in the `X-Total-Count` response header.

# Server Performance

This API is intended to be integrated into motor freight carriers back end operations systems; therefore, there are
performance requirements to be considered as well. The API has been modeled in terms of use cases by the motor freight
carriers (see below). Each of these use cases can be considered to be executing concurrently in the motor freight
carrier. This has important design implications. For example, if a motor freight carrier has 10,000 trucks and makes
requests regarding their location once a minute this would imply 10,000 method invocations per minute with a relatively
small return data point. Other methods such as vehicle histories will have larger return data sets and require more
server side processing but would not be expected to be called with a high frequency. Given that it is not possible to
understand how these methods might be used by motor freight carriers in a final implementation it is difficult to
provide concrete performance metric requirements at this stage. Instead, implementors should consider this per-truck
scaling and design accordingly. i.e. consider that fleets can have more than 100,000 trucks and that some API endpoints
in this specification will be called rapidly (1 request per minute) whereas others will be called infrequently (1
request per day).

This specification does not go into implementation specific design decisions which are up to the individual TSPs since
such decisions are heavily dependent on their architecture. It is, however, strongly recommended that the TSPs consider
building-in performance features such as request queueing and request rate limiters to provide a stable and robust
solution. It is also recommended that the TSPs provide information on the frequency of updates for data feed
subscriptions such as the vehicle feed so the consumers can make appropriate design decisions.

# Response Size Limits

Considering the volume of data which will be generated by large fleets, there will be cases where pagination is not
sufficient to limit the load on the TSP's OTAPI servers.

The TSPs implementing OTAPI may elect to return an error `413 Request Entity Too Large` when clients make queries which
would yield a response which is deemed 'too large.' The definition of 'too large' is intentionally left open so that
TSPs can configure different limits for the various endpoints and on a per-customer basis (based on e.g. tiers of
service).

Client software must be prepare to receive error `413` and to react by reducing the size of the query or ceasing the
query; client may not retry a request when receiving a `413` error. This specification lists the endpoints where clients must be
prepared for `413` responses.

# Unknown Drivers

For the elements of Open Telematics API which are concerned with Driver log events, or other driver-associated data,
there needs to be a concept of an 'unknown driver'. Indeed this concept is part of the ELD mandate. In Open Telematics
API objects: `driverID` references to the unknown driver is represented by `null`.

# Provider Identifiers
<a id="provider_identifiers"></a>

An important use case of the Open Telematics API by motor freight carriers is to run 'mixed fleets' where there are more
than one TSP's service integrated concurrently. In such a seployment we can imagine possible issues with duplicated data
or conflicts.

To prepare a solution to these problems, this specification includes provisions to identify the source of all data by a
'Provider ID'. Implementors are required to choose a unique identifier and assign it to all 'Provider ID' fields in all
data structures where it is included in this specification. We reccommend that TSPs use their domain (e.g.
`api.provider.com`) which should be sufficiently unique; however, TSPs can elect to use whatever identifier they like
but it should be 1) recognizable as associated with that TSP and 2) remain constant throughout the lifetime of the TSP's
service.

# Extending This API

The Open Telematics API is intended to enable motor freight carriers to be able to substitute TSPs (either concurently
or as fail-overs). This, of course, means that OTAPI must include only the most common elements of all the TSPs (so-
called Lowest Common Denominator).

However, each TSP has their own special value-add and, in some cases, the motor freight carriers would rather have
access to this special value-add via OTAPI rather than include parallel integrations with SDKs in their operations.
Unique vehicle performance data is a good example of this, where it is more useful embedded with the other events in the
TSP stream.

Thus, extensions to the API will be necessary and in preparation for this the data models specified in the current API
have been left 'open'. i.e. the addition of data fields to the definitions of the objects which are returned by OTAPI
according to this specification will not cause validation errors by clients which are following the JSON schema in this
specification.

Addition of fields to the objects must be done such that it is not possible for the new extension fields to collide with
other extensions or with future versions of the API; therefore, all fields added as extensions must be prefixed with
`x_providerid_` where `providerid` is the provider ID (see [Provider Identifiers](#provider_identifiers) for more
details).

* Adding addional field/members to the data objects, when the data is needed by a motor freight carrier IS a valid extension to the OTAPI
* Adding additional possible values to enumerations IS NOT a valid extension to the OTAPI
* Adding additional endpoints/methods IS NOT a valid extension to the OTAPI

In cases where enumerations need to be changed and additional endpoints need to be added, this should be approached by
changing the OTAPI upstream. Also, ideally, adding fields should also be done by suggesting changes upstream; in this
case, an example roadmap of the process might look like: starting with a prefixed field in the TSP extensions then
suggesting the useful fields for inclusion and review leading to a new field without a prefix.

# Localization

The Open Telematics API is ready to be used in locales other than the United States (English-speakers). To enable
display and interpretation of data in languages other English (US, `en_US`) implementors may provide translations of the
descriptions of the enumerated constants in the API.

The localization does not apply to units of measure. Open Telematics API will use SI units with the following exceptions:

* velocities where units of `km/h` are used
* [Log Event objects](#log_event_object) where units of either miles or kilometres are used (but not both)

The localization also does not apply to arbitrary strings in data objects of the API such as messages for display in
vehicles or comment fields.

Requests to [Get a Translation `GET /v1.0/i18n`](#get_a_translation_table) shall include the request header `Accept-
Language: `. If no request header is present then `Accept-Language: en` will be assumed.

Open Telematics API implementors choose which languages they will support. If the `Accept-Language: ` request header
specifies a language which is unsupported by the Open Telematics API instance, then a `406` (Not Acceptable) response
will returned. Implementors must support `Accept-Language: en` and return a complete mapping -- a sample of which is
provided below for convenience in the sample response to [`GET /v1.0/i18n`](#get_a_translation_table).

# Telematics API Use Cases by Motor Freight Carriers

The Open Telematics API is envisioned to be complete enough that motor freight carriers can use these APIs instead of
the proprietary TSP APIs -- while still connecting-to TSP-hosted servers and hence still using the same provider. In the
interest of ensuring that the APIs are _useful_ to their intended users (motor freight carriers) we will capture -- and
organize -- the API by these use cases. Each use case description in the following subsections includes links to the
API endpoints upon which the use case relies. The links can be followed to the *Reference* section for details on the
endpoint. It is the intention of the authors that each endpoint is defined to satisfy a use case and no endpoint
is introduced without a supporting use case captured here.

## Check Provider's State of Health

Users of telematics that is highly integrated into their operations need assurances of the state of health of the
Provider's services.

The IT and operations staff responsible for system uptime want to query the Open Telematics API provider (TSP) Provider
State of Health. They expect to receive either an 'all-clear' response indicating that the provider is not aware of any
issues with its services at the moment of query or some details describing the contributing factors that have led to
less than optimal operation.

To check the current state of health of the service they use

* [Check Current State of Health `GET /v1.0/health/current`](#check_current_state_of_health)

To check the past 30 days worth of states of health they use

* [Check Past 30d State of Health `GET /v1.0/health/recents`](#check_past_30d_state_of_health)

## Data Export

Motor freight carriers want to export all data from a TSP on a daily basis. Where 'all data' for the purposes of
this specification is all the data specified here and does not include any other proprietary data structures designed
and employed by the TSP. These data exports could be used by carriers to complete mandatory processes during times of
TSP outage or to restore data -- although this last potential use is _not_ a use case we aim to support in OTAPI.

To obtain a complete data export (including driver information) they use

* [Complete Telematics Export Format `GET /v1.0/export/allrecords/status{?dayOf}`](#complete_telematics_export_format).

To obtain a data export with vehicle information only (intended to be free of PII) they use

* [Vehicle-Only Telematics Export Format `GET /v1.0/export/vehiclerecords/status{?dayOf}`](#vehicle_only_telematics_export_format).

## Generate Records of Duty Status for Compliance

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to maintain Record of Duty Status (RODS) compliance. The TSP to the
carrier will supply compliant records directly, without the need for the carrier to use the OTAPI. The carrier may use
OTAPI for RODS in the event that compliant records need to be produced when a TSP is no longer available. i.e. as a
backup process only; however, to do so will require processing and it is not expected that OTAPI data be ready for
compliance as-is. A couple examples; the `line data check` and `file data check` values will need to be calculated after
the creation of line and files in the process of creating RODS files for compliance; OTAPI will not include these
values. Also note that preparing compliance reports is a value added by TSPs; e.g. in at least one case, the ordering
used by regulators used truncated timestamps and the higher-resolution available in the TSP RODS information led to
events being out-of-order in the view of the regulators without special handling by the TSP. This is an example of the
kinds of nuances that are handled by TPSs in their service offering and OTAPI is not meant to replace that service.

Personnel responsible for compliance need to be able to create RODS based on information exported from OTAPI in the
event a TSP is no longer available.

See [Complete Telematics Export Format `GET /v1.0/export/allrecords/status{?dayOf}`](#complete_telematics_export_format) for more details on the file format
which should contain sufficient data for this use case in the array of [Log Event objects](#log_event_object).

## Driver Availability

Motor freight carriers need to understand the availability of their drivers -- within the current regulatory context of
those drivers -- so that the carrier can ensure regulatory compliance and, more importantly, driver safety.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to model the current
availability of a Driver. They have

* a [Driver object id](#driver_object) for a given driver

To calculate the current driver availablity they retrieve 'driver availability factors' from which the current driver
availability can be calculated using

* [Get Driver Availability Factors `GET /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/availability_factors/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_driver_availability_factors) for a given [Driver object id](#driver_object) over a given period of time

To consider also the breaks and exemption rules for driver in those logs (if they operate in regions with specific break
rules or waivers) they use

* [Get Driver Breaks and Waivers `GET /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/breaks_and_waivers/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_driver_breaks_and_waivers) a given [Driver object id](#driver_object) over a given period of time

In some cases, facilities systems want to set the driver status in cases where they are on-duty but not driving. To do
this their systems send duty status changes to the TSP using

* [Update Driver Duty Status `PATCH /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/duty_status`](#update_driver_duty_status) for a given [Driver object id](#driver_object).

## Driver Route & Directions Communication

Motor freight carriers update their Driver's destination and route during their trip. This allows them to react to
changing conditions in weather, the needs of regulatory restrictions on hours, optimizing follow-on activities after a
trip, etc.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to update the
Driver's destination and route during a trip. They have

* a [Driver object id](#driver_object) for a given driver
* a [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) for a given vehicle
* and because they previously [created a *Vehicle Route* `POST /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/routes`](#create_a_vehicle_route) they have both
    * a *Vehicle Route object id* and
    * an array of [Stop Geographic Details object id](#stop_geographic_details_object).

To confirm that the given driver is still available to complete the route they retrieve the driver availability factors
for the time period from the driver's start of route up until the present by using

* [Get Driver Availability Factors `GET /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/availability_factors/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_driver_availability_factors) endpoint for a given [Driver object id](#driver_object) over a given period of time

To change the route they use

* [Update Vehicle Route `PUT /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/routes/{routeId}`](#update_vehicle_route) for a given [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) and a given *Vehicle Route object id*

To update details (entry points, notes) of the route stops they use

* [Update Stop Geographic Details `PATCH /v1.0/stops/{stopId}`](#update_stop_geographic_details) for a given [Stop Geographic Details object id](#stop_geographic_details_object)

## Driver Route & Directions Start

Motor freight carriers plan destinations and routes for their drivers and inform the drivers of the plan via the in-cab
components of a telematics system.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to inform their
drivers about their planned route before the driver starts the trip. They have

* a [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) for a given vehicle

To first check the vehicle for any faults or alarms in the past 24h they use

* [Get Vehicle Flagged Events `GET /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/flagged_events/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_vehicle_flagged_events) for a given [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) over a given period of time

Assuming the vehicle is good to go, then they send trip start and stop destinations to the driver along with any other
instructions (such as which trailers to take) using

* [Create a Vehicle Route `POST /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/routes`](#create_a_vehicle_route) for a given [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object)

A successful creation of a route will yield a *Route object id* and an array of [Stop Geographic Details object id](#stop_geographic_details_object) in the response to use in further updates or modifications
to the route or stops.

## Driver Route and Directions Done

Motor freight carriers receive notifications when Drivers have completed their trip.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to be notified of a
completed trip, along with the driver information about duty on the trip. They have

* a [Driver object id](#driver_object) for a given driver
* and because they previously [created a *Vehicle Route* `POST /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/routes`](#create_a_vehicle_route) and may have optionally
[updated the driver's Route Stop `PUT /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/routes/{routeId}`](#update_vehicle_route) or [updated the *Stop Geographic Details* `PATCH /v1.0/stops/{stopId}`](#update_stop_geographic_details)
they hence have both
    * a *Vehicle Route object id* and
    * a [Stop Geographic Details object id](#stop_geographic_details_object).

To react to the route completions in 'real-time' they follow a feed using

* [Follow Fleet Log Events `GET /v1.0/event_logs/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_log_events) for all drivers

They mark trips completed based on matching a [Log Event object](#log_event_object) in the feed which matches a given
[Driver object id](#driver_object) and also has a status indicating that the route is complete.

At the end of trips they also query for any updates on changes to gates, access, repairs etc at the destination using

* [Get Stop Geographic Details by its ID `GET /v1.0/stops/{id}`](#get_a_stop_geographic_details_by_its_id) for a given [Stop Geographic Details object id](#stop_geographic_details_object)

## Dispatch Messaging (by Driver)

Motor freight carriers need to enable their drivers to 'call-back' to the dispatch in a timely and safe manner. To do this
they often rely on two-way messaging provided by the TSP. The drivers can create and send messages to dispatch at the
motor freight carrier by using an interface on their in-cab displays.

Both personel and semi-automated systems responsible for drivers in the field, "Dispatch", need to be notified of new
messages. To process the invoming messages for Dispatch in 'real time' they follow a feed using

* [Follow Dispatch Messages `GET /v1.0/fleet/dispatchmessages/feed{?token}`](#follow_dispatch_messages)

## Driver Messaging by Geo-Location

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to message their drivers for various reasons, not the least of which is to
notify the drivers of dangerous weather conditions in their area.

Personnel responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to send messages to drivers in a particular
geographic region. They have

* a target geographic area, to which they want to send messages

To determine which vehicles presently lie within the geographic area they get the current location of all fleet vehicles
using

* [Get Fleet Latest Locations `GET /v1.0/fleet/locations/latest{?page,count}`](#get_fleet_latest_locations)

Then, for each [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) which lies within the geographic area they send it a message using

* [Send Message to a Vehicle `POST /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/message`](#send_message_to_a_vehicle) for a given [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object)

## Driver Messaging by Vehicle

Motor freight carriers also message their drivers by sending messages directly to a vehicle.

Personnel responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to send a message to a driver's vehicle. They have

* a [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) to which they wish to send a message

they send the vehicle a message using

* [Send Message to a Vehicle `POST /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/message`](#send_message_to_a_vehicle) for a given [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object)

## Vehicle Location Time History Processing

Motor freight carriers use telematics fleet Location Time History for multiple 'fleet dynamics modeling' use cases such
as: Fuel Purchase Prediction, Fuel Consumption Performance Tracking, and Fleet Maintenance Planning. They have

* a target time period, over which they want to perform an analysis of fleet location time history

To perform the analysis on fleet location time history they use

* [Get Fleet Location History `GET /v1.0/fleet/locations/{?startTime,stopTime,page,count}`](#get_fleet_location_history) for a given time period

## Human Resources Process: Payroll

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to assist in payroll processing. This enables efficiencies at scale that
are important to modern motor freight carrier operations.

Automated payroll/HR systems want to receive Log Events and convert these into payroll tracking entries.

To do create payroll tracking entries in 'real-time' they follow the feed of [Log Events](#log_event_object) using

* [Follow Fleet Log Events `GET /v1.0/event_logs/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_log_events) for all drivers

furthermore -- if they operate in regions with specific break rules or waivers are applicable -- they use

* [Get Driver Breaks and Waivers `GET /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/breaks_and_waivers/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_driver_breaks_and_waivers) for each [Driver object id](#driver_object) in the
feed for the times of interest to the payroll tracking entries

In some cases, facilities systems want to set the driver status in cases where they are on-duty but not driving. To do
this their systems send data _to_ the TSPs using

* [Update Driver Duty Status `PATCH /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/duty_status`](#update_driver_duty_status) endpoint for a given [Driver object id](#driver_object).

and the duty status changes are reflected in the [Follow Fleet Log Events `GET /v1.0/event_logs/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_log_events) endpoint.

To associate their Driver's with metadata for use by the TSP (e.g. the region of governance for duty breaks and
exemptions) they use

* [Update Driver Info `PATCH /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}`](#update_driver_info) for a given [Driver object id](#driver_object).

## Human Resources Process: Accident Report

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to monitor their fleets for accidents.

Semi-automated systems want to receive notification of any accidents in their fleet and handle accident reports
internally according to their own processes.

To do respond to accidents in 'real-time' they follow the feed of [Log Events](#log_event_object) using

* [Follow Fleet Log Events `GET /v1.0/event_logs/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_log_events) for all drivers

## Carrier Custom Business Intelligence

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems for multiple, custom, business intelligence purposes where the overall
health of their fleet is considered and fed into their own proprietary models.

Automated and semi-automated analysis and reporting systems want to get the overall fleet health status for a particular
time period.

To process the fleet state over a target time period they use

* [Get Fleet Vehicle Info `GET /v1.0/fleet/infos/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_fleet_vehicle_info) for a given time period

To process and respond to fleet status in 'real-time' they follow a feed using

* [Follow Fleet Vehicle Info `GET /v1.0/fleet/infos/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_vehicle_info) for all vehicles

To follow-up with queries of the hi-resolution time history of the fleet for a given time period they use

* [Get Fleet Location History `GET /v1.0/fleet/locations/{?startTime,stopTime,page,count}`](#get_fleet_location_history) for a given time period.

## Compliance and Safety Monitoring

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to monitor compliance and safety for their operations.

Personnel responsible for safety and compliance want to review the safety and compliance of their drivers. They have:

* a [Driver object id](#driver_object) for a given driver
* a time period of interest

To obtain the information necessary to review for safety and compliance they use

* [Get Driver Performance Summaries `GET /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/performance_summaries/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_driver_performance_summaries) for a given [Driver object id](#driver_object) and for a given time period

To create, delete and modify driver login credentials that the drivers will use in the
field and to which the [Driver Performance Summary objects](#driver_performance_summary_object) are associate they use

* [Update Driver TSP Portal Account `PATCH /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/driverportaluser`](#update_driver_tsp_portal_account) for a given [Driver object id](#driver_object)

## In-Field Maintenance & Repair

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to plan (and react to) maintenance needs of their fleets.

Automated back-end systems at the motor freight carrier want to be notified of any vehicle issues requiring maintenance.

To determine which events require maintenance in 'real-time' they follow a feed using

* [Follow Fleet Fault Code Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/faults/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_fault_code_events) for all fleet vehicles

To dispatch assitance to the location of a given [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) -- in the event that an issue
requiring maintenance must be resolved in the field -- they obtain the most recent vehicle location using

* [Get Vehicle Location History `GET /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/locations/{?startTime,stopTime}`](#get_vehicle_location_history) for a given [Vehicle object id](#vehicle_object) over the most recent time period

## Machine-Readable Data Quality

Motor freight carriers rely on data quality properties of the service provided by TSPs and need to be able to adapt
their back-end systems depending on the various data quality propoerties of a given TSP's service.

To determine what the expected data qualities of the service are, they use

* [Get Data Qualities Statement `GET /v1.0/dataquality`](#get_data_qualities_statement).

## Estimating Received Data Quality

Motor freight carriers need to estimate certain data quality properties of their service for a given time period.

To gain these estimates they post-process either the complete or vehicle only records for the given time period from

* [Complete Telematics Export Format `GET /v1.0/export/allrecords/status{?dayOf}`](#complete_telematics_export_format) OR
* [Vehicle-Only Telematics Export Format `GET /v1.0/export/vehiclerecords/status{?dayOf}`](#vehicle_only_telematics_export_format)

For example, estimates of received data latency can be obtained by processing downloads from either of the above and
summarizing the difference between the created timestamps and server timestamps.

## Monitor Vehicle Status Events

Motor freight carriers need access to raw J1939 vehicle frames for various custom fleet management tasks. To process the raw frames in 'real-time' they follow a feed using

* [Follow Fleet Status Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/statusevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_status_events) for all fleet vehicles.

NB: These vehicle status events are largely *raw* J1939 data. Open Telematics API makes no requirements on how the TSP
determines what raw frames to send via this interface. It is expected that the motor freight carrier and the TSP
configure/agree-to the set of raw data via some other mechanism.

Furthermore, truck leasing companies need to have access to this raw vehicle status data via single-purpose accounts at
the motor freight carrier's TSP. i.e. the truck leasing company does not require access to any other information so the account has a
single role and no further permissions. For this, the leasing companies also use

* [Follow Fleet Status Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/statusevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_status_events) for all fleet vehicles.

## Monitor Fleet Battery Status

Motor freight carriers need to monitor the battery voltage of their fleet of vehicles.

To monitor these battery voltages in 'real time' they follow a feed using

* [Follow Fleet Performance Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/performanceevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_performance_events) for all fleet vehicles

Alternatively, the motor freight carriers may follow a feed using

* [Follow Fleet Status Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/statusevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_status_events) for all fleet vehicles.

However, the latter may require special configuration for allowing the appropriate raw CAN frames to be sent via the
[Follow Fleet Status Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/statusevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_status_events) endpoint. Furthermore, the [Follow Fleet Status Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/statusevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_status_events)
endpoint may not produce data in as many ignition states as [Follow Fleet Performance Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/performanceevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_performance_events)
and the [Follow Fleet Performance Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/performanceevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_performance_events) may offer higher resolution on battery
voltage than [Follow Fleet Status Events `GET /v1.0/fleet/statusevents/feed{?token}`](#follow_fleet_status_events).

## Data Structures

### Open Telematics TSP Inbound Objects (object)

The objects below are forward definitions of the data object types used in sending data to the TSP in the API. These
objects do not need to have unique identification because they are processed by the server into changes to existing
objects or creating new objects. Because these are inbound objects, extra attention should be paid to restricting the
allowable space of values in these objects to enable robust input sanitization by implementors.

Note 1: due to the way the apiary documentation renderer works, this section will not be visible when rendered there.
See the *Open Telematics Data Model* for a section designed to be rendered in apiary.

Note 2: And this object definition exists just to tell you about that limitation.

Note 3: Also, any descriptions put on these data structures will not get rendered properly, so consult the *Open
Telematics Data Model* section for object descriptions as well.

Note 4 (who's counting these anyways?): as these are inbound objects we want lock-down the space of all possible
serializations to make the input processing of the server more robust. e.g. specifying content restrictions for strings
that should only contain timestamps. APIBlueprint doesn't provide a way to do this in MSON; but it is possible to add a
JSON Schema to an action which overides the JSON schema generated from the MSON. So, whereas these data structures
define the data types used for inbound objects, there is also corresponding JSON Schemas for endpoints accepting these
data type defined below. If you change one you should probably also change the other.

Note 5: WARNING, changes to the objects here require also changing the explicit JSON Schema sections added to the
endpoint `Request`s in the API Blueprint that follows.

## Update Stop Geographic Details                           [PATCH /v1.0/stops/{stopId}]
<a id="update_stop_geographic_details"></a>

Clients can update the _geographic details_ of a stop; the *Stop Geographic Details* are the specific location for the
truck and trailer to park and a polygon of geographic points indicating the entryway onto a facility (i.e. where the
truck should drive on approach).

Sending data to this endpoint, using a previously returned `stopId` will update the geograhic details of the stop and
any other routes using this stop will also be updated.

<a id="follow_fleet_status_events"></a>

Clients can follow a feed of Vehicle Status Events as they are added to the TSP system; following is accomplished via
polling an endpoint and providing a 'token' which evolves the window of new entries with each query in the polling.

These vehicle status events are largely *raw* J1939 data. Open Telematics API makes no requirements on how the TSP
determines what raw frames to send via this interface. It is expected that the motor freight carrier and the TSP
configure/agree-to the set of raw data via some other mechanism.

# Group Data Export

***On Data Import***

The carriers would also like to be able to use the exported data in an 'import' to a second TSP or new instances of the
same TSP. This is not an use case which this specification will attempt to support; however, we will aim to design the
data structures such that any TSP wanting to implement _import_ is enabled to do so (c.f. 'Provider ID').

***PII Separation***

The carriers need to be able to deploy systems which do not touch PII -- as is treated in the Authorization section
above. OTAPI implementations must provide for export of both [Vehicle-Only Telematics Export Format](#vehicle_only_telematics_export_format)
and [Complete Telematics Export Format](#complete_telematics_export_format) objects so that systems which must be separated
from PII can download the [Vehicle-Only Telematics Export Format](#vehicle_only_telematics_export_format) type. As is
noted in the access controls below, requests for these data types deny access by the *Vehicle X* roles.

***Polling for Daily Files***

The IT staff and automated systems that want to retreive the data exports on a daily basis will do so by polling the
server for the status of the given's days complete record. The polling endpoint will either indicate that the file is
not yet ready, or respond with a redirect to a location serving the complete file (statically).

Implementors are free to make the files available for download from any service they choose. If the service hosting the
files for download exposes endpoints under that of the OTAPI endpoints then the same authentication and authorization
schemes must be enforced. If the files are made available for download elsewhere then they must not be made accessible
without any authentication or authorization and the client is expected to be configured with the appropriate credentials
for download independently of responses from the OTAPI server.

***Time-base for Data Export***

Note that the data export files will include both time-varying objects (those that have time associated with them) and
also those that do not.

* For time-varying objects: the files will only include whose associated time periods have an intesection with the
requested time period (as per the details of the [Working With Dates](#working_with_dates) section above);

* For non time-varying objects: the files will include all objects known to the TSP at the time of the request,
regardless of the time period requested as defined by `start` and `stop` query parameters (included on the endpoints for
API consistency under `/export/...`)

Furthermore, the event and object times considered in the time queries for data export use *received times* (as opposed
the default policy of relying on *creation times*). These are the times when the event or object was received, recorded
and/or made available by the OTAPI server. This could pose problems for processing exported data for RODS compliance as
multiple files may need to be processed in high-latency situations; however, the alternative is allow for data loss in
the daily export files.

***Complete Data Export***

The *Complete* objects will contain sets of all of the following objects embedded.

* [Vehicle](#vehicle_object)
* [Vehicle Location Time](#vehicle_location_time_object)
* [Vehicle Flagged Event](#vehicle_flagged_event_object)
* [Vehicle Performance Event](#vehicle_performance_event_object)
* [Stop Geographic Details](#stop_geographic_details_object)
* [Vehicle Status Event](#vehicle_status_event)
* [Vehicle Fault Code Event](#vehicle_fault_code_event_object)
* [Driver](#driver_object)
* [Log Event](#log_event_object)
* [Region Specific Break Rules](#region_specific_break_rules_object)
* [Region Specific Waivers](#region_specific_waivers_object)
* [Driver Performance Summary](#driver_performance_summary_object)
* [Message Receipt](#message_receipts)
* [Dispatch Message](#dispatch_message)
* [State of Health](#state_of_health_object)

***Vehicle-Only Data Export***

The *Vehicle-Only* objects will contain sets of all of the following objects embedded.

* [Vehicle](#vehicle_object)
* [Vehicle Location Time](#vehicle_location_time_object)
* [Vehicle Flagged Event](#vehicle_flagged_event_object)
* [Vehicle Performance Event](#vehicle_performance_event_object)
* [Stop Geographic Details](#stop_geographic_details_object)
* [Vehicle Status Event](#vehicle_status_event)
* [Vehicle Fault Code Event](#vehicle_fault_code_event_object)
* [State of Health](#state_of_health_object)

# Group Open Telematics Data Model

For the purposes of clearly detailing the data object types used by the API endpoints above, we include the object
models here along with simple 'get by id' APIs. These simple APIs could be useful for debugging and inspection purposes;
it is expected that the 'use case based' API endpoints defined above will be of more use in integration than these.
