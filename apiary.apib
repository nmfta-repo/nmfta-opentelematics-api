This document is written using [api-blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) and available online at both [opentelematicsapi.docs.apiary.io](https://opentelematicsapi.docs.apiary.io/#) (for browsable document) and https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api for the API blueprint source. Please use https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api to raise issues and suggest changes to the API.

If a telematics system provider (TSP) suddenly goes out of business
(have had two examples of this in 2018) any commercial fleet relying on
their service will need to find a new provider. Due to the lack of a
standardized telematics data format, a commercial fleet manager will
have to reintegrate an alternate telematics provider's data format into
their existing system reporting.

The Open Telematics API is intended to make the TSP-Carrier interface the same across multiple TSPs. It is not intended to specify any aspects of the TSP's connections to their telematics devices. Neither does it imply any changes to the location where data is stored or access controls on the data -- the data will still live at the Motor Freight Carrier as-sourced from their accounts at the TSP.

![NMFTA Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api/master/media/overview.png)

This is a standardized API for retrieving telematics logs & data.
Each participating TSP would be individually responsible for the necessary
translations from their existing formats to this Open Telematics
API. Each TSP would continue to be responsible for managing their
own cloud infrastructure housing customer data. The Open Telematics API, as an additional interface,
will be made available by TSPs to allow their customers ready
access to pull data in the standardized format, especially in examples
of mixed TSP fleets.

# Contributors

This Open Telematics API was made possible through the generous contributions of thought leadership and technical expertise 
of many collaborators across the heavy vehicle cyber security community, working to push the industry forward and make it 
more resilient. Though some of our contributors wish to remain anonymous, we are deeply grateful to everyone who has given 
their time and energy to make this a reality.

# Authentication

**All requests** to Open Telematics API endpoints **require authentication**.

For this version of the API, `v1`, all authentication must be performed using HTTP Basic. e.g.

```http
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```

This authentication method relies entirely on the security protections provided by the TLS layer; therefore HTTPS is
mandatory on all connections and implementors must follow adhere to the security requirements detailed in the *Security
Requirements for Implementors* section below.

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must provide a means to create username-password pair credentials and these
must be associated with roles (see section *Authorization* below).

# Authorization

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must include access controls for requests against the following roles.

* *Vehicle Query*
* *Vehicle Follow*
* *Driver Query*
* *Driver Follow*
* *Driver Dispatch*
* *Driver Duty*
* *HR*
* *Admin*

It must be possible for clients to usernames for Authentication (see above) which are assigned to **one role and no more
than one role**.

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must restrict authorization of requests to only those roles that are assigned
in the **Access Controls** tables throughout this API specification. The tables will look like the following example:

|Role:  |Vehicle Query|Vehicle Follow|Driver Query|Driver Follow|Driver Dispatch|Driver Duty |HR          |Admin       |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|------------|
|Access:|`DENY/ALLOW` |`DENY/ALLOW`  |`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW` |`DENY/ALLOW`   |`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW`|

The intent of these access controls is so that carriers can limit which clients they deploy have access to:
* any resources at all
* any Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
* streaming feeds of new events as they are added to the TSP

As can be seen in the **Access Controls** tables in the requests subsections of *References* that follow, the roles
are assigned `DENY/ALLOW` such that:
* the *X Follow* roles have access to streaming feeds and queries, whereas the *X Query* roles have access only to collections
queries and
* the *Vehicle X* roles are intended to be safe from PII
* the *Driver Dispatch* role is allowed to update route info and send messages to drivers
* the *Driver Duty* role is allowed to externaly trigger driver duty status (e.g. *Send Duty Status Changes to the TSP*)
* the *HR* role is allowed to update Driver information and TSP portal user accounts

# Security Requirements for Implementors

All TSPs that implement an Open Telematics API instance are expected to
provide a secure service by default. In what follows we outline some
security requirements that are expected in addition to the authentication
and access control that is detailed in the sections above.

## General Security Requirements

Vendors must maintain a vulnerability response and disclosure program in
accordance with established standards such as International Organization
of Standards (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
29147:2014 (Information technology \-- Security techniques \--
Vulnerability Disclosure) and ISO/IEC 30111:2013 (Information technology
\-- Security techniques \-- Vulnerability Handling Processes).

Vendors should ensure their vulnerability response and disclosure
program conforms with the ['Legal bug bounty' safe-harbor requirements](https://github.com/EdOverflow/legal-bug-bounty)
to protect researchers and encourage the highest-quality participation.

## Open Telematics API Server Security Requirements

**TLS Configuration**

The TLS security for Open Telematics API servers is of paramount importance. All of the confidentiality and integrity
protections are relying on this layer. For this reason, Open Telematics API servers must ensure that their HTTPS / TLS
configurations are of the highest quality. Following the [Qualys SSL Labs
Guide](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices) is reccomended.  The automated
tool, also by Qualys SSL Labs, at [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) will report a
'letter grade'; it is expected that TSPs will have letter grades of 'A' or higher according to that tool.

**Whitelist HTTP Methods**

This API specification (in *APIBlueprint*) has a complete list of all allowable *HTTP methods* for each resource/'end
point' of the Open Telematics API. Open Telematics server implementations should use the list of methods as a whitelist
to filter incoming requests before any additional processing.

**Rate-limit API Requests**

Since every request to the Open Telematics API must be authenticated it is possible to rate-limit Open Telematics API
requests per authenticated user. Vendors should implement rate limits on overall API requests per authenticated user,
e.g. to avoid one user exhausting server resources of others; however, vendor must not rate-limit any Open Telematics
API implementations to rates below what is offered through their other API services for telematics data.

**Prevent Brute-Forcing**

Authentication (for this version of the API) is tied exclusively to HTTP Basic in each request. This means that each and
every API endpoint is an opportunity to brute force any of the user credentials. Open Telematics server implementors
must enforce a global rate-limit on authentication attempts for each user. Implementors may also want to consider other
mitigations against brute-force attacks on credentials; c.f. [the OWA page on Blocking Brute Force
Attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks).

**Prevent Server-Error Stacktraces**

Open Telematics server implementors must ensure that their software is deployed such that it does not include stack
traces in any response; e.g. no stacktraces in a 500 server error response.

**Prevent Resource Exhaustion by Slow-posting**

Open Telematics server implementors must ensure that, when receiving data from clients, the server implements short-
enough timeouts such that exhaustion of the server resources through malicious client 'slow-posting' is not possible.
For more details, consult this [Qualys blog post](https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2011/11/02/how-to-protect-
against-slow-http-attacks).

**Input Sanitization**

Open Telematics server implementors must employ input sanitization when ingesting any data, i.e. for the `POST`, `PUT`,
`PATCH` methods. This API uses exclusively JSON for data serialization; therefore, at a minimum all input data should be
verified as valid JSON before being further processed. Furthermore, this specification includes generated JSON schema
for the expected inputs and so additional verification that the input JSON conforms to the expected schema can also be
performed before further processing is performed.

## Open Telematics API Client Security Requirements

**Certificate Pinning**

Because the confidentiality of credentials is only protected by TLS in this version, it is
very important that all Open Telematics API clients must be configured such that substitution of
any TLS certificates results in a failure to establish any connections
to the Open Telematics API server.

All clients must implement certificate pinning. i.e. All client implementations will pass the tests, 5.4-5.6, for
certificate pinning in the [OWASP MASVS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide).

# Working With Dates

When exchanging dates as parameters to API methods or in responses from the API, you must ensure that
they are formatted properly as an ISO 8601 string (format
`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ`). In addition, all dates will have to first be
converted to UTC in order to ensure time zone information and daylight
savings times are accounted for correctly.

## Working with Time-Based Queries

There are many API endpoints which support searches of data based on a time range. In all cases, the time rage specified
by a pair of `start` and `stop` parameters represents an inclusive-exclusive time range. i.e. a time period which
includes the moment in time given by `start` and all times up-to but not including the moment in time given by `stop.`

The matching performed in all of these searches will be a time-intersection. i.e. the objects will be returned in search
results if their associated time periods (however defined) have any intersection with the inclusive-exclusive time range
given by the pair of `start` and `stop` parameters.

# Working With Locations

When exchanging locations as parameters to API methods or in responses from the API, you must ensure
that they are formatted as a latitude+longitude pair (format `[-]aaa.aaaaaaa [-]ooo.ooooooo`).

# Error States

The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.

# Server Performance

This API is intended to be integrated into motor freight carriers back end operations systems; therefore, there are
performance requirements to be considered also. The API has been modeled in terms of use cases by the motor freight
carriers (see below). Each of these use cases can be considered to be executing concurrently in the motor freight
carrier. For large motor freight carriers, each use case interacts with TSP servers at up to 10,000 requests per minute.

Therefore, server implementations of this API are expected to be able to serve 10,000 requests per minute per use case.

# Provider Identifiers

An important use case of the Open Telematics API by motor freight carriers is to run 'mixed fleets' where there are more
than one TSP's service integrated concurrently. In such a seployment we can imagine possible issues with duplicated data
or conflicts.

To prepare a solution to these problems, this specification includes provisions to identify the source of all data by a
'Provider ID'. Implementors are required to choose a unique identifier and assign it to all 'Provider ID' fields in all
data structures where it is included in this specification. We reccommend that TSPs use their domain (e.g.
`api.provider.com`) which should be sufficiently unique; however, TSPs can elect to use whatever identifier they like
but it should be 1) recognizable as associated with that TSP and 2) remain constant throughout the lifetime of the TSP's
service.

# Localization

The Open Telematics API is ready to be used in locales other than the United States (English-speakers). To enable
display and interpretation of data in languages other English (US, `en_US`) implementors may provide translations of the
descriptions of the enumerated constants in the API.

The localization does not apply to units of measure. In all cases the Open Telematics API will use SI units. Nor does
the localization apply to arbitrary strings in data objects of the API such as messages for display in vehicles or
comment fields.

Requests to the Translation `/i18n` endpoint (see below for more details) shall include the request header `Accept-
Language: `. If no request header is present then `Accept-Language: en` will be assumed.

Open Telematics API implementors choose which languages they will support. If the `Accept-Language: ` request header
specifies a language which is unsupported by the Open Telematics API instance, then a `406` (Not Acceptable) response
will returned. Implementors must support `Accept-Language: en` and return a complete mapping -- a sample of which is
provided below for convenience in the sample response to `GET /api{version}/i18n`.

# Telematics API Use Cases by Motor Freight Carriers

The Open Telematics API is envisioned to be complete enough that motor freight carriers can use these APIs instead of
the proprietary TSP APIs -- while still connecting-to TSP-hosted servers and hence still using the same provider. In the
interest of ensuring that the APIs are _useful_ to their intended users (motor freight carriers) we will capture -- and
organize -- the API by these use cases.

## Data Structures

### Open Telematics Data Model Objects (object)

## Data Structures

### Open Telematics TSP Inbound Objects (object)

The objects below are forward definitions of the data object types used in sending data to the TSP in the API. These
objects do not need to have unique identification because they are processed by the server into changes to existing
objects or creating new objects. Because these are inbound objects, extra attention should be paid to restricting the
allowable space of values in these objects to enable robust input sanitization by implementors.

Note 1: due to the way the apiary documentation renderer works, this section will not be visible when rendered there.
See the *Open Telematics Data Model* for a section designed to be rendered in apiary.

Note 2: And this object definition exists just to tell you about that limitation.

Note 3: Also, any descriptions put on these data structures will not get rendered properly, so consult the *Open
Telematics Data Model* for object descriptions as well.

# Group Use Case Check Provider's State of Health

Users of telematics that is highly integrated into their operations need assurances of the state of health of the
Provider's services.

The IT and operations staff responsible for system uptime want to query the Open Telematics API provider (TSP) Provider
State of Health. They expect to receive either an 'all-clear' response indicating that the provider is not aware of any
issues with its services at the moment of query or some details describing the contributing factors that have led to
less than optimal operation.

## Check Current State of Health [GET /api{version}/status]

Clients can request the current service status. The response to this query will be a data structure indicating
everything is good or showing some details as to why the service is not presently at 100%.

Clients must treat any response other than code 200 and code 401 as equivalent to `SERVICESTATUS_MAJOR_OUTAGE`.

## Check Past 30d State of Health [GET /api{version}/incidents]

Clients can request the recent history of all service statuses. The response to this query will return all service
status records (i.e. those returned via *Check Current State of Health*) from over the past 30 days.

Clients must treat any response other than code 200 and code 401 as equivalent to `SERVICESTATUS_MAJOR_OUTAGE`.

# Group Use Case Data Export

Motor freight carriers want to export all data from a TSP for a given time period. Where 'all data' for the purposes of
this specification is all the data specified here and does not include any other proprietary data structures designed
and employed by the TSP. These data exports could be used by carriers to complete mandatory processes during times of
TSP outage or for research purposes offline or to restore data -- although this last potential use is _not_ a use case
we aim to support here please see below on 'data import.'

The IT staff and automated systems want to retrieve a complete record of all TSP-hosted data (with caveat notes above)
for a given time-period. They do this by querying for either

* Complete Telematics Records OR Vehicle-Only Telematics Records

for a given period of time.

The carriers would also like to be able to use the exported data in an 'import' to a second TSP or new instances of the
same TSP. This is not an use case which this specification will attempt to support; however, we will aim to design the
data structures such that any TSP wanting to implement _import_ is enabled to do so (c.f. 'Provider ID').

+ Attributes (Complete Telematics Records)

### Retrieve Complete Telematics Records for a Given Time Period [GET]

Clients can retrieve the entirety of all Telematics data from the TSP for a given time period.

The response to this request will include both time-varying objects (those that have time associated with them) and also
those that do not. The response will only include those time-varying objects whose associated time periods have an
intesection with the requested time period (as per the details of the *Working With Dates* section above); the response
will also include the entire list of all non time-varying objects known to the TSP at the time of the request,
regardless of the time period requested as defined by `start` and `stop` query parameters.

### Retrieve Vehicle-Only Complete Telematics Records for a Given Time Period [GET]

Clients can retrieve the entirety of all Telematics data from the TSP -- that data which does not deal with Driver PII
-- for a given time period.

The response to this request will include both time-varying objects (those that have time associated with them) and also
those that do not. The response will only include those time-varying objects whose associated time periods have an
intesection with the requested time period (as per the details of the *Working With Dates* section above); the response
will also include the entire list of all non time-varying objects known to the TSP at the time of the request,
regardless of the time period requested as defined by `start` and `stop` query parameters.

# Group Use Case Driver Availability

Motor freight carriers need to understand the availability of their drivers -- within the current regulatory context of
those drivers -- so that the carrier can ensure regulatory compliance and, more importantly, driver safety.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to model the current
availability of a Driver; they retrieve all of the following 'driver availability factors' from that time up until the
current moment, from which the current driver availability can be calculated.

* Coarse Vehicle Location Time History
* Vehicle Flagged Event
* Duty Status Log

The same personnel and semi-automated systems will need to for breaks and exemption rules for drivers in those logs if
they operate in regions with specific break rules or waivers.

* Region Specific Breaks Rules
* Region Specific Waivers

In some cases, facilities systems want to set the driver status in cases where they are on-duty but not driving. To do
this their systems send data _to_ the TSPs.

* Externally Triggered Duty Status Change

## Retrieve Driver Availability Factors [GET /api{version}/driveravailability/{driverId}{?start,stop}]

Clients can request all the factors contributing to driver availability for a given driver, over a given time period.

# Group Use Case Driver Route & Directions Communication

Motor freight carriers update their Driver's destination and route during their trip. This allows them to react to
changing conditions in weather, the needs of regulatory restrictions on hours, optimizing follow-on activities after a
trip, etc.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to update the
Driver's destination and route during a trip. They retrieve the driver availability factors for the time period from the
driver's start of route up until the present (see *Retrieve Driver Availability Factors* above for more details.)

In the process of updating the Driver's destination and route, the motor freight carrier sends the following _to_ the
TSP

* Stop Geographic Details
* Stop Details

## Update Driver's Route Stop [PUT /api{version}/vehicles/{vehicleId}/routes/{routeId}]

Clients can update a Driver's destination; sending data to this endpoint, using a previously obtained `routeId` will
change the destination of the route, hence also changing the stopId associated with the route.

components of a telematics system.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to inform their

route, they first check the vehicle for any faults or alarms in the past 24h by querying this endpoint.

* Vehicle Flagged Event

Then the trip start and stop destination is sent to the driver along with any other instructions (such as which trailers
to take). A successful creation of a route will yield a response indicating the routeId to use in further updates or
modifications to the route.

# Group Use Case Driver Route and Directions Done

Motor freight carriers receive notifications when Drivers have completed their trip.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to be notified of a
completed trip, along with the driver information about duty on the trip. They follow the feed of:

* Duty Status Log

And mark trips completed based on the Duty Status Log context; at the end of a trip they also query for the most recent

* Stop Geographic Details

to receive updates on changes to gates, access, repairs etc at the destination (see *Retrieve Route Stop Geographic
Details* above for more details.)

## Follow a Feed of Duty Status Logs [GET /api{version}/dutystatuslogs/feed{?token}]

Clients can follow a feed of Duty Status Log entries as they are added to the TSP system; following is accomplished via
polling an endpoint and providing a 'token' which evolves the window of new entries with each query in the polling.

Motor freight carriers use telematics fleet Location Time History for multiple 'fleet dynamics modeling' use cases such
as: Fuel Purchase Prediction, Fuel Consumption Performance Tracking, and Fleet Maintenance Planning.

Autonomous analysis and reporting systems want to get the Location Time History of the fleet over a particular time
period. They query the API for

* Vehicle Location Time History

of all vehicles over a given time period.

## Retrieve All Vehicle Location Time Histories [GET /api{version}/vehiclelocations/{?start,stop}]

Clients can retrieve the (hi-resolution) vehicle locations (of all vehicles) over a given time period.

# Group Use Case Human Resources Process: Payroll

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to assist in payroll processing. This enables efficiencies at scale that
are important to modern motor freight carrier operations.

Automated payroll/HR systems want to receive duty status logs and convert these into payroll tracking entries. To do
this they follow a feed of:

* Duty Status Log

(see *Follow a Feed of Duty Status Logs* above for more details) and they query for breaks and exemption rules for
(drivers in those logs:

* Region Specific Breaks Rules
* Region Specific Waivers

(see *Check Break Rules and Waivers* above for more details.)

In some cases, facilities systems want to set the driver status in cases where they are on-duty but not driving. To do
this their systems send data _to_ the TSPs:

* Externally Triggered Duty Status Change

(see *Send Custom-Integrated Duty Status Changes to the TSP* above for more details.) HR staff want to associate their
(Driver's with metadata for use by the TSP. e.g. the region of governance for duty breaks and exemptions. To do this
(their systems send data _to_ the TSPs:

* Externally Sourced Driver Info

## Update Driver with Externally Sourced Driver Info [PATCH /api{version}/drivers/{driverId}]

Clients can request updates to the TSP's managed user accounts for drivers by sending data to this endpoint.

# Group Use Case Human Resources Process: Accident Report

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to monitor their fleets for accidents.

Semi-automated systems want to receive notification of any accidents in their fleet and handle accident reports
internally according to their own processes. To do this they follow a feed of:

* Duty Status Log

(see *Follow a Feed of Duty Status Logs* above for more details.)

# Group Use Case Carrier Custom Business Intelligence

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems for multiple, custom, business intelligence purposes where the overall
health of their fleet is considered and fed into their own proprietary models.

Automated and semi-automated analysis and reporting systems want to get the overall fleet health status for a particular
time period. They query the API for

* Coarse Vehicle Location Time History
* Flagged Vehicle Performance Event
* Vehicle Performance Event
* Vehicle Fault Code Event

of all vehicles over a given time period.

They may also follow-up with queries of the hi-resolution time history of the fleet for a given time period:

* Vehicle Location Time History

(see *Retrieve All Vehicle Location Time Histories* above for more details.)

# Group Use Case In-Field Maintenance & Repair

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to plan (and react to) maintenance needs of their fleets.

Automated back-end systems at the motor freight carrier want to be notified of any vehicle issues requiring maintenance.
The systems determine which events require maintenance by following a feed of:

* Vehicle Fault Code Event

In the event that an issue requiring maintenance must be resolved in the field, the system will query to get the most
recent vehicle location

* Vehicle Location Time History

## Follow a Feed of All Vehicle Fault Code Events [GET /api{version}/vehiclefaults/feed?{token}]

Clients can follow a feed of Vehicle Fault Code Events as they are added to the TSP system; following is accomplished
bia polling an endpoint and providing a 'token' which evolves the window of new entries with each query in the polling.
