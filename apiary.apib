# Open Telematics API

A project to enable business resiliency for motor freight carriers with tight integrations into Telematics Service Providers (TSPs).

This document is written using [api-blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) and available online at both
[opentelematicsapi.docs.apiary.io](https://opentelematicsapi.docs.apiary.io/#) (for browsable document) and
https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api for the API blueprint source. Please use https://github.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api to raise issues and suggest changes to the API.

If a telematics system provider (TSP) suddenly goes out of business
(have had two examples of this in 2018) any commercial fleet relying on
their service will need to find a new provider. Due to the lack of a
standardized telematics data format, a commercial fleet manager will
have to reintegrate an alternate telematics provider's data format into
their existing system reporting.

The Open Telematics API (OTAPI) is intended to make the TSP-Carrier interface the same across multiple TSPs. It is not
intended to specify any aspects of the TSP's connections to their telematics devices. Neither does it imply any changes
to the location where data is stored or access controls on the data -- the data will still live at the Motor Freight
Carrier as-sourced from their accounts at the TSP.

![NMFTA Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfta-repo/nmfta-opentelematics-api/master/media/overview.png)

This is a standardized API for retrieving telematics logs & data.
Each participating TSP would be individually responsible for the necessary
translations from their existing formats to this Open Telematics
API. Each TSP would continue to be responsible for managing their
own cloud infrastructure housing customer data. The Open Telematics API, as an additional interface,
will be made available by TSPs to allow their customers ready
access to pull data in the standardized format, especially in examples
of mixed TSP fleets.

# Contributors

This Open Telematics API was made possible through the generous contributions of thought leadership and technical expertise
of many collaborators across the heavy vehicle cyber security community, working to push the industry forward and make it
more resilient. Though some of our contributors wish to remain anonymous, we are deeply grateful to everyone who has given
their time and energy to make this a reality.

# Authentication

**All requests** to Open Telematics API endpoints **require authentication**.

For this version of the API, `v1`, all authentication must be performed using HTTP Basic. e.g.

```http
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```

This authentication method relies entirely on the security protections provided by the TLS layer; therefore HTTPS is
mandatory on all connections and implementors must follow adhere to the security requirements detailed in the *Security
Requirements for Implementors* section below.

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must provide a means to create username-password pair credentials and these
must be associated with roles (see section *Authorization* below).

# Authorization

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must include access controls for requests against the following roles.

* *Vehicle Query*
* *Vehicle Follow*
* *Driver Query*
* *Driver Follow*
* *Driver Dispatch*
* *Driver Duty*
* *HR*
* *Admin*

It must be possible for clients to usernames for Authentication (see above) which are assigned to **one role and no more
than one role**.

TSPs implementing the Open Telematics API must restrict authorization of requests to only those roles that are assigned
in the **Access Controls** tables throughout this API specification. The tables will look like the following example:


|Role:  |Vehicle Query|Vehicle Follow|Driver Query|Driver Follow|Driver Dispatch|Driver Duty |HR          |Admin       |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|------------|
|Access:|`DENY/ALLOW` |`DENY/ALLOW`  |`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW` |`DENY/ALLOW`   |`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW`|`DENY/ALLOW`|

The intent of these access controls is so that carriers can limit which clients they deploy have access to:
* streaming *feeds* of objects as they are added to the TSP
* any Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

As can be seen in the **Access Controls** tables in the requests subsections of *References* that follow, the roles
are assigned `DENY/ALLOW` such that:

* the *X Query* roles have access only to collections queries
* the *X Follow* roles have access to streaming feeds and queries
* the *Vehicle X* roles cannot access any PII
* the *Driver X* roles can access both vehicle info and PII
* the *Driver Dispatch* role is allowed to update route info and send messages to drivers
* the *Driver Duty* role is allowed to externaly trigger driver duty status (e.g. *Send Duty Status Changes to the TSP*)
* the *HR* role is allowed to update Driver information and TSP portal user accounts

# Security Requirements for Implementors

All TSPs that implement an Open Telematics API instance are expected to
provide a secure service by default. In what follows we outline some
security requirements that are expected in addition to the authentication
and access control that is detailed in the sections above.

## General Security Requirements

Vendors must maintain a vulnerability response and disclosure program in
accordance with established standards such as International Organization
of Standards (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)
29147:2014 (Information technology \-- Security techniques \--
Vulnerability Disclosure) and ISO/IEC 30111:2013 (Information technology
\-- Security techniques \-- Vulnerability Handling Processes).

Vendors should ensure their vulnerability response and disclosure
program conforms with the ['Legal bug bounty' safe-harbor requirements](https://github.com/EdOverflow/legal-bug-bounty)
to protect researchers and encourage the highest-quality participation.

## Open Telematics API Server Security Requirements

**TLS Configuration**

The TLS security for Open Telematics API servers is of paramount importance. All of the confidentiality and integrity
protections are relying on this layer. For this reason, Open Telematics API servers must ensure that their HTTPS / TLS
configurations are of the highest quality. Following the [Qualys SSL Labs
Guide](https://github.com/ssllabs/research/wiki/SSL-and-TLS-Deployment-Best-Practices) is reccomended.  The automated
tool, also by Qualys SSL Labs, at [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) will report a
'letter grade'; it is expected that TSPs will have letter grades of 'A' or higher according to that tool.

**Whitelist HTTP Methods**

This API specification (in *APIBlueprint*) has a complete list of all allowable *HTTP methods* for each resource/'end
point' of the Open Telematics API. Open Telematics server implementations should use the list of methods as a whitelist
to filter incoming requests before any additional processing.

**Rate-limit API Requests**

Since every request to the Open Telematics API must be authenticated it is possible to rate-limit Open Telematics API
requests per authenticated user. Vendors should implement rate limits on overall API requests per authenticated user,
e.g. to avoid one user exhausting server resources of others; however, vendor must not rate-limit any Open Telematics
API implementations to rates below what is offered through their other API services for telematics data. Rate-limiting
response must be implemented using response 429 and headers as detailed in this document.

**Prevent Brute-Forcing**

Authentication (for this version of the API) is tied exclusively to HTTP Basic in each request. This means that each and
every API endpoint is an opportunity to brute force any of the user credentials. Open Telematics server implementors
must enforce a global rate-limit on authentication attempts for each user. Implementors may also want to consider other
mitigations against brute-force attacks on credentials; c.f. [the OWA page on Blocking Brute Force
Attacks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks).

**Prevent Server-Error Stacktraces**

Open Telematics server implementors must ensure that their software is deployed such that it does not include stack
traces in any response; e.g. no stacktraces in a 500 server error response.

**Prevent Resource Exhaustion by Slow-posting**

Open Telematics server implementors must ensure that, when receiving data from clients, the server implements short-
enough timeouts such that exhaustion of the server resources through malicious client 'slow-posting' is not possible.
For more details, consult this [Qualys blog post](https://blog.qualys.com/securitylabs/2011/11/02/how-to-protect-
against-slow-http-attacks).

**Input Sanitization**

Open Telematics server implementors must employ input sanitization when ingesting any data, i.e. for the `POST`, `PUT`,
`PATCH` methods. This API uses exclusively JSON for data serialization; therefore, at a minimum all input data should be
verified as valid JSON before being further processed. Furthermore, this specification includes generated JSON schema
for the expected inputs and so additional verification that the input JSON conforms to the expected schema can also be
performed before further processing is performed.

## Open Telematics API Client Security Requirements

**Certificate Pinning**

Because the confidentiality of credentials is only protected by TLS in this version, it is
very important that all Open Telematics API clients must be configured such that substitution of
any TLS certificates results in a failure to establish any connections
to the Open Telematics API server.

All clients must implement certificate pinning. i.e. All client implementations will pass the tests, 5.4-5.6, for
certificate pinning in the [OWASP MASVS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Testing_Guide).

# Working With Dates

When exchanging dates as parameters to API methods or in responses from the API, you must ensure that
they are formatted properly as an ISO 8601 string (format
`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffZ`). In addition, all dates will have to first be
converted to UTC in order to ensure time zone information and daylight
savings times are accounted for correctly.

# Working with Time-Based Queries

There are many API endpoints which support searches of data based on a time range. In all cases, the time range specified
by a pair of `start` and `stop` parameters represents an inclusive-exclusive time range. i.e. a time period which
includes the moment in time given by `start` and all times up-to but not including the moment in time given by `stop.`

The matching performed in all of these searches will be a time-intersection. i.e. the objects will be returned in search
results if their associated time periods (however defined) have any intersection with the inclusive-exclusive time range
given by the pair of `start` and `stop` parameters.

Objects may have multiple time periods associated with them; e.g. events recorded and transmitted by TSPs may have the
times at which the event was created, when it was recorded and/or when it was made available by the TSP to the motor
freight carrier. Unless otherwise specified, the time period of objects against which matching is performed will be the
*creation times*. Furthermore, implementors are required to ensure that the creation times of any objects are preserved
through all data transfers, i.e. that the creation times are not modified after initial recording at the telematics
devices in the field.

In the special case of matching against an object with a single time field, *instantaneous events* the object will be
returned if its instantaneous time value is within the inclusive-exclusive time range given by the pair of `start` and
`stop` parameters.

# Working With Locations

When exchanging locations as parameters to API methods or in responses from the API, you must ensure that they are
formatted as a latitude+longitude pair (format `[-]aaa.aaaaaaa [-]ooo.ooooooo`). Positive in the first component,
Latitude, indicates North (N) and East (E) in the second component, Longitude.

Note that all locations assigned to objects by the TSP in the OTAPI are done so on a best-effort basis. Different TSPs
have different rates of location update, different accuracies and different means of mapping a previously known location
into events after the known location (e.g. prediction vs. interpolation). This Open Telematics API draft does not make
any specifications about how often, how accurate or any other statements about how geographic locations must be assigned
to objects by the TSP.

# Working with *Feed Follow* Queries

There are endpoints of the API which are intended to be polled by clients so that new data (data newer than the previous
query) is returned. Theses *Feed Follow* endpoints are intended to assist in real-time client applications.

In some cases, the clients require that no data is ever missed by following (polling the endpoint); however, due to the
nature of telematics systems there can be a high latency between time of creation and time of delivery to the TSP. Hence
there is a non-trivial cost associated with providing endpoints that can ensure that no data is missed in following.
e.g. the *Follow a Feed of Log Events* endpoint below.

Unless stated otherwise, all *Feed Follow* endpoints will be such that no data is missed by following; including cases
of very high latency between data creation and delivery. Special exceptions will be noted on the endpoints for the cases
where the clients require that they have the newest information and are not concerned with ensuring that no data is
missed.

# Error States

The common [HTTP Response Status Codes](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/status-codes.md) are used.

# Pagination

Where requests may return large collections and where the collections to be returned are presumed to be static the API
will include support for pagination of requests. The scheme for pagination closely follows [the pagination scheme of github](https://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).

Requests that are paginated will return 50 items by default. The `page` parameter can be used to access later pages;
it defaults to the first page, page *1*. A custom number of items can be requested with the `count` parameter.

The total number of elements available is returned in the `X-Total-Count` response header.

# Server Performance

This API is intended to be integrated into motor freight carriers back end operations systems; therefore, there are
performance requirements to be considered as well. The API has been modeled in terms of use cases by the motor freight
carriers (see below). Each of these use cases can be considered to be executing concurrently in the motor freight
carrier. This has important design implications. For example, if a motor freight carrier has 10,000 trucks and makes
requests regarding their location once a minute this would imply 10,000 method invocations per minute with a relatively
small return data point. Other methods such as vehicle histories will have larger return data sets and require more
server side processing but would not be expected to be called with a high frequency. Given that it is not possible to
understand how these methods might be used by motor freight carriers in a final implementation it is difficult to
provide concrete performance metric requirements at this stage. Instead, implementors should consider this per-truck
scaling and design accordingly. i.e. consider that fleets can have more than 100,000 trucks and that some API endpoints
in this specification will be called rapidly (1 request per minute) whereas others will be called infrequently (1
request per day).

This specification does not go into implementation specific design decisions which are up to the individual TSPs since
such decisions are heavily dependent on their architecture. It is, however, strongly recommended that the TSPs consider
building-in performance features such as request queueing and request rate limiters to provide a stable and robust
solution. It is also recommended that the TSPs provide information on the frequency of updates for data feed
subscriptions such as the vehicle feed so the consumers can make appropriate design decisions.

# Response Size Limits

Considering the volume of data which will be generated by large fleets, there will be cases where pagination is not
sufficient to limit the load on the TSP's OTAPI servers.

The TSPs implementing OTAPI may elect to return an error `413 Request Entity Too Large` when clients make queries which
would yield a response which is deemed 'too large.' The definition of 'too large' is intentionally left open so that
TSPs can configure different limits for the various endpoints and on a per-customer basis (based on e.g. tiers of
service).

Client software must be prepare to receive error `413` and to react by reducing the size of the query or ceasing the
query; client may not retry a request when receiving a `413` error. This draft lists the endpoints where clients must be
prepared for `413` responses.

# Unknown Drivers

For the elements of Open Telematics API which are concerned with Driver log events, or other driver-associated data,
there needs to be a concept of an 'unknown driver'. Indeed this concept is part of the ELD mandate. In Open Telematics
API objects: `driverID` references to the unknown driver is represented by `null`.

# Provider Identifiers

An important use case of the Open Telematics API by motor freight carriers is to run 'mixed fleets' where there are more
than one TSP's service integrated concurrently. In such a seployment we can imagine possible issues with duplicated data
or conflicts.

To prepare a solution to these problems, this specification includes provisions to identify the source of all data by a
'Provider ID'. Implementors are required to choose a unique identifier and assign it to all 'Provider ID' fields in all
data structures where it is included in this specification. We reccommend that TSPs use their domain (e.g.
`api.provider.com`) which should be sufficiently unique; however, TSPs can elect to use whatever identifier they like
but it should be 1) recognizable as associated with that TSP and 2) remain constant throughout the lifetime of the TSP's
service.

# Extending This API

The Open Telematics API is intended to enable motor freight carriers to be able to substitute TSPs (either concurently
or as fail-overs). This, of course, means that OTAPI must include only the most common elements of all the TSPs (so-
called Lowest Common Denominator).

However, each TSP has their own special value-add and, in some cases, the motor freight carriers would rather have
access to this special value-add via OTAPI rather than include parallel integrations with SDKs in their operations.
Unique vehicle performance data is a good example of this, where it is more useful embedded with the other events in the
TSP stream.

Thus, extensions to the API will be necessary and in preparation for this the data models specified in the current API
have been left 'open'. i.e. the addition of data fields to the definitions of the objects which are returned by OTAPI
according to this specification will not cause validation errors by clients which are following the JSON schema in this
specification.

Addition of fields to the objects must be done such that it is not possible for the new extension fields to collide with
other extensions or with future versions of the API; therefore, all fields added as extensions must be prefixed with
`x_providerid_` where `providerid` is the provider ID (see *Provider Identifiers* above for more details).

* Adding addional field/members to the data objects, when the data is needed by a motor freight carrier IS a valid extension to the OTAPI
* Adding additional possible values to enumerations IS NOT a valid extension to the OTAPI
* Adding additional endpoints/methods IS NOT a valid extension to the OTAPI

In cases where enumerations need to be changed and additional endpoints need to be added, this should be approached by
changing the OTAPI upstream. Also, ideally, adding fields should also be done by suggesting changes upstream; in this
case, an example roadmap of the process might look like: starting with a prefixed field in the TSP extensions then
suggesting the useful fields for inclusion and review leading to a new field without a prefix.

# Localization

The Open Telematics API is ready to be used in locales other than the United States (English-speakers). To enable
display and interpretation of data in languages other English (US, `en_US`) implementors may provide translations of the
descriptions of the enumerated constants in the API.

The localization does not apply to units of measure. With the exception of velocities where units of `km/h` are used,
the Open Telematics API will use SI units. Nor does the localization apply to arbitrary strings in data objects of the
API such as messages for display in vehicles or comment fields.

Requests to the Translation `/i18n` endpoint (see below for more details) shall include the request header `Accept-
Language: `. If no request header is present then `Accept-Language: en` will be assumed.

Open Telematics API implementors choose which languages they will support. If the `Accept-Language: ` request header
specifies a language which is unsupported by the Open Telematics API instance, then a `406` (Not Acceptable) response
will returned. Implementors must support `Accept-Language: en` and return a complete mapping -- a sample of which is
provided below for convenience in the sample response to `GET /v1.0/i18n`.

# Telematics API Use Cases by Motor Freight Carriers

The Open Telematics API is envisioned to be complete enough that motor freight carriers can use these APIs instead of
the proprietary TSP APIs -- while still connecting-to TSP-hosted servers and hence still using the same provider. In the
interest of ensuring that the APIs are _useful_ to their intended users (motor freight carriers) we will capture -- and
organize -- the API by these use cases. See the sections below for the API endpoints in those categories. For ease of
reference, we summarize the use cases here:

***Check Provider's State of Health***

Users of telematics that is highly integrated into their operations need assurances of the state of health of the
Provider's services.

***Data Export***

Motor freight carriers want to export all data from a TSP for a given time period. Where 'all data' for the purposes of
this specification is all the data specified here and does not include any other proprietary data structures designed
and employed by the TSP. These data exports could be used by carriers to complete mandatory processes during times of
TSP outage or for research purposes offline or to restore data -- although this last potential use is _not_ a use case
we aim to support here please see below on 'data import.'

***Generate Records of Duty Status for Compliance***

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to maintain Record of Duty Status (RODS) compliance. The TSP to the
carrier will supply compliant records directly, without the need for the carrier to use the OTAPI. The carrier may use
OTAPI for RODS in the event that compliant records need to be produced when a TSP is no longer available. i.e. as a
backup process only; however, to do so will require processing and it is not expected that OTAPI data be ready for
compliance as-is. A couple examples; the `line data check` and `file data check` values will need to be calculated after
the creation of line and files in the process of creating RODS files for compliance; OTAPI will not include these
values. Also note that preparing compliance reports is a value added by TSPs; e.g. in at least one case, the ordering
used by regulators used truncated timestamps and the higher-resolution available in the TSP RODS information led to
events being out-of-order in the view of the regulators without special handling by the TSP. This is an example of the
kinds of nuances that are handled by TPSs in their service offering and OTAPI is not meant to replace that service.

***Driver Availability***

Motor freight carriers need to understand the availability of their drivers -- within the current regulatory context of
those drivers -- so that the carrier can ensure regulatory compliance and, more importantly, driver safety.

***Driver Route & Directions Communication***

Motor freight carriers update their Driver's destination and route during their trip. This allows them to react to
changing conditions in weather, the needs of regulatory restrictions on hours, optimizing follow-on activities after a
trip, etc.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

***Driver Route & Directions Start***

Motor freight carriers plan destinations and routes for their drivers and inform the drivers of the plan via the in-cab
components of a telematics system.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

***Driver Route and Directions Done***

Motor freight carriers receive notifications when Drivers have completed their trip.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

***Driver Messaging by Geo-Location***

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to message their drivers for various reasons, not the least of which is to
notify the drivers of dangerous weather conditions in their area.

***Driver Messaging by Vehicle***

Motor freight carriers also message their drivers by sending messages directly to a vehicle.

***Vehicle Location Time History Tracking***

Motor freight carriers use telematics fleet Location Time History for multiple 'fleet dynamics modeling' use cases such
as: Fuel Purchase Prediction, Fuel Consumption Performance Tracking, and Fleet Maintenance Planning.

***Human Resources Process: Payroll***

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to assist in payroll processing. This enables efficiencies at scale that
are important to modern motor freight carrier operations.

***Human Resources Process: Accident Report***

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to monitor their fleets for accidents.

***Carrier Custom Business Intelligence***

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems for multiple, custom, business intelligence purposes where the overall
health of their fleet is considered and fed into their own proprietary models.

***Compliance and Safety Monitoring***

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to monitor compliance and safety for their operations.

***In-Field Maintenance & Repair***

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to plan (and react to) maintenance needs of their fleets.

## Data Structures

### Open Telematics TSP Inbound Objects (object)

The objects below are forward definitions of the data object types used in sending data to the TSP in the API. These
objects do not need to have unique identification because they are processed by the server into changes to existing
objects or creating new objects. Because these are inbound objects, extra attention should be paid to restricting the
allowable space of values in these objects to enable robust input sanitization by implementors.

Note 1: due to the way the apiary documentation renderer works, this section will not be visible when rendered there.
See the *Open Telematics Data Model* for a section designed to be rendered in apiary.

Note 2: And this object definition exists just to tell you about that limitation.

Note 3: Also, any descriptions put on these data structures will not get rendered properly, so consult the *Open
Telematics Data Model* section for object descriptions as well.

Note 4 (who's counting these anyways?): as these are inbound objects we want lock-down the space of all possible
serializations to make the input processing of the server more robust. e.g. specifying content restrictions for strings
that should only contain timestamps. APIBlueprint doesn't provide a way to do this in MSON; but it is possible to add a
JSON Schema to an action which overides the JSON schema generated from the MSON. So, whereas these data structures
define the data types used for inbound objects, there is also corresponding JSON Schemas for endpoints accepting these
data type defined below. If you change one you should probably also change the other.

# Group Use Case Check Provider State of Health

Users of telematics that is highly integrated into their operations need assurances of the state of health of the
Provider's services.

The IT and operations staff responsible for system uptime want to query the Open Telematics API provider (TSP) Provider
State of Health. They expect to receive either an 'all-clear' response indicating that the provider is not aware of any
issues with its services at the moment of query or some details describing the contributing factors that have led to
less than optimal operation.

## Check Current State of Health                               [GET /v1.0/health/current]

Clients can request the current service state of health. The response to this query will be a data structure indicating
everything is good or showing some details as to why the service is not presently at 100%.

Clients must treat any response other than code 200, code 401, or code 429 as equivalent to `SERVICESTATUS_MAJOR_OUTAGE`.

# Group Use Case Data Export

Motor freight carriers want to export all data from a TSP on a daily basis. Where 'all data' for the purposes of
this specification is all the data specified here and does not include any other proprietary data structures designed
and employed by the TSP. These data exports could be used by carriers to complete mandatory processes during times of
TSP outage or to restore data -- although this last potential use is _not_ a use case we aim to support in OTAPI.

***Data Import***

The carriers would also like to be able to use the exported data in an 'import' to a second TSP or new instances of the
same TSP. This is not an use case which this specification will attempt to support; however, we will aim to design the
data structures such that any TSP wanting to implement _import_ is enabled to do so (c.f. 'Provider ID').

***PII Separation***

The carriers need to be able to deploy systems which do not touch PII -- as is treated in the Authorization section
above. OTAPI implementations must provide for export of both *Vehicle Only Complete Telematics Records* and *Complete
Telematics Records* objects so that systems which must be separated from PII can download the *Vehicle Only Complete
Telematics Records* type. As is noted in the access controls below, requests for these data types
deny access by the *Vehicle X* roles.

***Polling for Daily Files***

The IT staff and automated systems that want to retreive the data exports on a daily basis will do so by polling the
server for the status of the given's days complete record. The polling endpoint will either indicate that the file is
not yet ready, or respond with a redirect to a location serving the complete file (statically).

Implementors are free to make the files available for download from any service they choose. If the service hosting the
files for download exposes endpoints under that of the OTAPI endpoints then the same authentication and authorization
schemes must be enforced. If the files are made available for download elsewhere then they must not be made accessible
without any authentication or authorization and the client is expected to be configured with the appropriate credentials
for download independently of responses from the OTAPI server.

***Time-base for Data Export***

Note that the data export files will include both time-varying objects (those that have time associated with them) and
also those that do not.

* For time-varying objects: the files will only include whose associated time periods have an intesection with the
requested time period (as per the details of the *Working With Dates* section above);

* For non time-varying objects: the files will include all objects known to the TSP at the time of the request,
regardless of the time period requested as defined by `start` and `stop` query parameters (included on the endpoints for
API consistency under `/export/...`)

Furthermore, the event and object times considered in the time queries for data export use *received times* (as opposed
the default policy of relying on *creation times*). These are the times when the event or object was received, recorded
and/or made available by the OTAPI server. This could pose problems for processing exported data for RODS compliance as
multiple files may need to be processed in high-latency situations; however, the alternative is allow for data loss in
the daily export files.

***Complete Data Export***

The *Complete Data Export* objects will contain all of the following object embedded, see *Complete Telematics Records
Daily Export Format* below for more details.

* Vehicle
* Vehicle Location Time History
* Vehicle Flagged Event
* Vehicle Performance Event
* Performance Thresholds
* Stop Geographic Details
* Vehicle Fault Code Event
* Driver
* Log Event
* Region Specific Break Rules
* Region Specific Waivers
* Driver Performance Summary
* State of Health

***Vehicle-Only Data Export***

The *Vehicle Only Complete Telematics Records* objects will contain only the following embedded objects, see *Vehicle-
Only Complete Telematics Records Daily Export Format* for more details.

* Stop Geographic Details
* Performance Thresholds
* Vehicle
* Vehicle Location Time History
* Vehicle Flagged Event
* Vehicle Performance Event
* Vehicle Fault Code Event

# Group Use Case Generate Records of Duty Status for Compliance

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to maintain Record of Duty Status (RODS) compliance. The TSP to the
carrier will supply compliant records directly, without the need for the carrier to use the OTAPI. The carrier may use
OTAPI for RODS in the event that compliant records need to be produced when a TSP is no longer available. i.e. as a
backup process only; however, to do so will require processing and it is not expected that OTAPI data be ready for
compliance as-is. A couple examples; the `line data check` and `file data check` values will need to be calculated after
the creation of line and files in the process of creating RODS files for compliance; OTAPI will not include these
values. Also note that preparing compliance reports is a value added by TSPs; e.g. in at least one case, the ordering
used by regulators used truncated timestamps and the higher-resolution available in the TSP RODS information led to
events being out-of-order in the view of the regulators without special handling by the TSP. This is an example of the
kinds of nuances that are handled by TPSs in their service offering and OTAPI is not meant to replace that service.

Personnel responsible for compliance need to be able to create RODS based on information exported from OTAPI in the
event a TSP is no longer available.

See *Complete Telematics Records Daily Export Format* above for more details on the file format which should contain
sufficient data for this use case in the array of *Log Event* objects.

# Group Use Case Driver Availability

Motor freight carriers need to understand the availability of their drivers -- within the current regulatory context of
those drivers -- so that the carrier can ensure regulatory compliance and, more importantly, driver safety.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to model the current
availability of a Driver; they retrieve all of the following 'driver availability factors' from that time up until the
current moment, from which the current driver availability can be calculated.

* Coarse Vehicle Location Time History
* Vehicle Flagged Event
* Log Event

The same personnel and semi-automated systems will need to for breaks and exemption rules for drivers in those logs if
they operate in regions with specific break rules or waivers.

* Region Specific Break Rules
* Region Specific Waivers

In some cases, facilities systems want to set the driver status in cases where they are on-duty but not driving. To do
this their systems send data _to_ the TSPs.

* Externally Triggered Duty Status Change

## Get Driver Availability Factors                             [GET /v1.0/drivers/{driverId}/availability_factors/{?startTime,stopTime}]

# Group Use Case Driver Route & Directions Communication

Motor freight carriers update their Driver's destination and route during their trip. This allows them to react to
changing conditions in weather, the needs of regulatory restrictions on hours, optimizing follow-on activities after a
trip, etc.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to update the
Driver's destination and route during a trip. They retrieve the driver availability factors for the time period from the
driver's start of route up until the present (see *Retrieve Driver Availability Factors* above for more details.)

In the process of updating the Driver's destination and route, the motor freight carrier sends the following _to_ the
TSP

* Stop Geographic Details
* Stop Details

## Update Driver Route Stop                                    [PUT /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/routes/{routeId}]

Clients can update a Driver's destination; sending data to this endpoint, using a previously obtained `routeId` will
change the destination of the route, hence also changing the stopId associated with the route.

# Group Use Case Driver Route & Directions Start

Motor freight carriers plan destinations and routes for their drivers and inform the drivers of the plan via the in-cab
components of a telematics system.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to inform their
drivers about their planned route before the driver starts the trip. Given the vehicle that the Driver will take on the
route, they first check the vehicle for any faults or alarms in the past 24h by querying this endpoint.

* Vehicle Flagged Event

Then the trip start and stop destination is sent to the driver along with any other instructions (such as which trailers
to take). A successful creation of a route will yield a response indicating the routeId to use in further updates or
modifications to the route.

* Externally Sourced Route Start Stop Details

## Get Vehicle Flagged Events                                  [GET /v1.0/vehicles/{vehicleId}/flagged_events/{?startTime,stopTime}]

# Group Use Case Driver Route and Directions Done

Motor freight carriers receive notifications when Drivers have completed their trip.

This feature is heavily used but also is commonly offered as an add-on to the TSP service from another party.

Both personnel and semi-automated systems responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to be notified of a
completed trip, along with the driver information about duty on the trip. They follow the feed of:

* Log Event

And mark trips completed based on the Log Event context; at the end of a trip they also query for the most recent

* Stop Geographic Details

to receive updates on changes to gates, access, repairs etc at the destination (see *Retrieve Route Stop Geographic
Details* above for more details.)

## Follow Fleet Log Events                                     [GET /v1.0/event_logs/feed{?token}]

Clients can follow a feed of Log Event entries as they are added to the TSP system; following is accomplished via
polling an endpoint and providing a 'token' which evolves the window of new entries with each query in the polling.

# Group Use Case Driver Messaging by Geo-Location

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to message their drivers for various reasons, not the least of which is to
notify the drivers of dangerous weather conditions in their area.

Personnel responsible for planning and assigning driver routes want to send messages to drivers in a particular
geographic region. They query the API for the most recent

* Vehicle Location Time History

of all vehicles; then filtering-out all vehicles outside the particular geographic region, then send messages to each
vehicle by sending data _to_ the TSP:

* Externally Sourced Vehicle Display Messages

## Get Fleet Latest Locations                                  [GET /v1.0/fleet/locations/latest{?page,count}]

# Group Use Case Human Resources Process: Payroll

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to assist in payroll processing. This enables efficiencies at scale that
are important to modern motor freight carrier operations.

Automated payroll/HR systems want to receive Log Events and convert these into payroll tracking entries. To do
this they follow a feed of:

* Log Event

(see *Follow a Feed of Log Events* above for more details) and they query for breaks and exemption rules for
(drivers in those logs:

* Region Specific Break Rules
* Region Specific Waivers

(see *Check Break Rules and Waivers* above for more details.)

In some cases, facilities systems want to set the driver status in cases where they are on-duty but not driving. To do
this their systems send data _to_ the TSPs:

* Externally Triggered Duty Status Change

(see *Send Custom-Integrated Duty Status Changes to the TSP* above for more details.) HR staff want to associate their
(Driver's with metadata for use by the TSP. e.g. the region of governance for duty breaks and exemptions. To do this
(their systems send data _to_ the TSPs:

* Externally Sourced Driver Info

# Group Use Case In-Field Maintenance & Repair

Motor freight carriers use telematics systems to plan (and react to) maintenance needs of their fleets.

Automated back-end systems at the motor freight carrier want to be notified of any vehicle issues requiring maintenance.
The systems determine which events require maintenance by following a feed of:

* Vehicle Fault Code Event

In the event that an issue requiring maintenance must be resolved in the field, the system will query to get the most
recent vehicle location

* Vehicle Location Time History

## Follow Fleet Fault Code Events                              [GET /v1.0/fleet/faults/feed{?token}]

Clients can follow a feed of Vehicle Fault Code Events as they are added to the TSP system; following is accomplished
bia polling an endpoint and providing a 'token' which evolves the window of new entries with each query in the polling.
